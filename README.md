Overview :  

The Word Cipher is a command-line utility that allows users to encrypt words using a secret key. By inputting a word and a corresponding key, the tool generates the corresponding ciphertext. This can be useful for secure communication or protecting sensitive information.

Features: 


Encryption: Input any word and a secret key to produce the encrypted ciphertext.

Decryption (Coming Soon): Future updates will include decryption functionality to reverse the process and retrieve the original word from the ciphertext.
Usage

Installation:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
Run the Encryption:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.

Execute the following command:
python DES.py

Follow the prompts to input your word and secret key.
View the Ciphertext:
The tool will display the resulting ciphertext.
Example
Suppose you want to encrypt the word “266200199BBCDFF1” with the key “0123456789ABCDEF” Running the tool will yield the following ciphertext:


Input word: 266200199BBCDFF1


Secret key: 0123456789ABCDEF

Ciphertext: 4E0E6864B5E1CA52


Notes:

Choose a strong and unique key for better security.

Keep your key confidential; anyone with the key can decrypt the ciphertext.
